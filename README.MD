- Tried to build a simple PHP Website using chatGPT  
- Build this under an hour  
- This is legally correct. You can also try  
- You can go through the prompt I've used to build this from [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/d7e77175-328d-42a0-8df0-1a1df1aeb769)

# How this idea?

- Was talking to my friend over some food blogging and related stuff and how we can start a food blogging & this suddenly stuck my mind like can we create a full php website using just chatgpt.  
- Nothing else. Like, I've even used SQL file to be created using chat GPT.  
- Glad I was able to create one.  


# Drawbacks

- Not able to create animations but can be added if we download certain libraries which, currently, I don't want to.  
- Moreover, you can contribute to this by adding your frontend skills in this skeleton.  
- My goal was just to create a website which should be working af. Not much user friendly, but certainly you can contribute to it rather.
